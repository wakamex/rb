I will list the `spec` directory to verify the file names and then read `spec/metrics_v1.yaml` and `spec/metrics_rationale.md` to confirm their contents.
Here is the review of `spec/metrics_v1.yaml` and `spec/metrics_rationale.md`.

### Top issues/suggestions

*   **Daily Series Aggregation (High)**: The `sp500` and `djia` series are Daily, but the spec does not define how to sample them for a "term" (e.g., inauguration date vs. nearest trading day). Without an explicit aggregation rule (e.g., `resample: M, method: last`), results will depend on implementation details of the joiner.
    *   *Rationale*: Start/End dates (Jan 20) rarely fall on month-ends. Comparing daily price changes to monthly/quarterly flows requires a strict alignment rule.
*   **Missing Real Wages (Med)**: The spec covers jobs and GDP but misses "Real Wages" (purchasing power), a critical component of "better economy" arguments.
    *   *Rationale*: GDP per capita includes corporate profits; real median wages `LES1252881600Q` (quarterly) or `AHETPI` (monthly, nominal) adjusted by CPI would track typical voter experience better.
*   **Annual Series Attribution (Med)**: `fyfsgda188s` (Deficit % GDP) is Annual. Presidential terms do not align with calendar years or fiscal years (which shifted in 1976).
    *   *Rationale*: Using annual data requires a documented decision on "Fiscal Year attribution" (e.g., "President X inherits FY of inauguration year").
*   **Cumulative Inflation Metric (Low)**: The primary inflation metric is `cpi_inflation_yoy_mean_nsa` (average annual rate). A "Total Price Level Change" (Cumulative % rise) would be more intuitive for "prices went up X% under President Y".

### Questions for implementation

1.  **Daily Alignment**: For `sp500` start/end, should we use the "closing price of Inauguration Day" (if trading) or "closing price of the day *before* Inauguration"? (Standard finance convention is often $P_{start}$ is close of $t-1$).
2.  **Fiscal Year Lag**: For `fyfsgda188s` (Annual), should we attribute the year of inauguration to the *outgoing* or *incoming* president? (Budget is usually set prior).
3.  **Recession Definition**: Does `recession_month_share` count a month as 1.0 if *any* day is recession, or only if the NBER peak happened before the 15th? (Using `USREC` monthly averages implies we accept the FRED monthly classification).
