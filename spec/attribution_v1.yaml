  Rules for attributing time-series observations to presidential terms (and
  later: Congress control regimes). This spec is separate from metric
  definitions so disagreements about "inherited economy" and boundary choices
  are explicit, parameterized, and auditable.

defaults:
  term_window:
    start_inclusive: true
    end_inclusive: false
    notes:
      - "Windows are [start, end) in calendar time unless an override is specified."

  # How to convert days into years for per-year normalizations.
  year_basis_days: 365.25

  # For period-valued macro series (M/Q/A), prefer majority-of-days attribution
  # within the period rather than naive use of the observation timestamp.
  period_attribution:
    rule: majority_of_days_in_period
    tie_breaker: president_on_period_end

  # For daily market series used as levels, define boundary selection rules.
  daily_boundary_rule:
    start: last_trading_day_strictly_before
    end: last_trading_day_strictly_before
    notes:
      - "Avoids time-of-day ambiguity on inauguration day and matches close-to-close conventions."

frequency_semantics:
  D:
    kind: instant
    notes:
      - "Observation timestamp is treated as the day it is reported for."
  M:
    kind: period
    period: calendar_month
    notes:
      - "FRED monthly series typically timestamp values at the first day of the month; we treat them as month-period values."
  Q:
    kind: period
    period: calendar_quarter
    notes:
      - "FRED quarterly series are treated as quarter-period values regardless of timestamp (often quarter start)."
  A:
    kind: period
    period: calendar_year

series_overrides:
  # Fiscal-year series need explicit rules. FYFSGDA188S is on a federal fiscal
  # year basis (Oct-Sep).
  fyfsgda188s_federal_surplus_deficit_pct_gdp:
    frequency: A
    kind: period
    period: us_fiscal_year
    fiscal_year_start_month: 10
    fiscal_year_start_day: 1
    notes:
      - "Attribution for fiscal-year values should be treated as a sensitivity dimension (e.g., majority-days vs president-at-FY-end)."
